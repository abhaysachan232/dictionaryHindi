            <p>In this lesson, you can learn how to learn, remember and use new
                vocabulary in ENGLISH. You can see the common mistake which many English
                make when learning vocabulary and you'll see several simple, practical
                ideas that you can use to build your English, vocabulary and remember
                what you learn. <br /><br>
                let's start with a general point that's very important. Here are some
                things we often hear from English learners: <br /><br>
                "I couldn't read it." <br /><br>
                There were too many words and I didn't have time to look them all up in
                the dictionary. <br /><br>
                "I wrote down all of these new words and I tried to learn them, but I
                can't remember any of them now!" <br /><br>
                Here's a fact about your brain: your brain is very good at throwing away
                things it doesn't need. <br /><br>
                Vocabulary learning starts when you choose which words and phrases to
                learn or not learn. This is where many English learners go wrong, by
                mistake one of these mistake: <br>
                <br />Trying to learn too many words. Trying to learn words you don't
                need. Trying to learn big lists of words. Trying to learn words you
                don't know how to use To avoid these mistakes, you need to choose the
                vocabulary you study carefully.
